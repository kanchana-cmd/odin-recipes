    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for pizza, a popular Sri Lankan street food, comes from Sanjeewa Gooneratne, who prepares the dish at events around New York on a griddle the size of a sled. A flaky flatbread is stir-fried with eggs and spices and finished with a curry sauce. Don't let the long list of spices deter you from making the dish. You can omit a few and still experience its fantastic depths of flavor</p>

            <li>2 teaspoons finely minced ginger</li>

            <li>1 cup julienne carrots (about ¼ pound)</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound Sri Lankan roti, cut into ½ inch pieces (or other flaky flatbread, like Indian paratha)</li>
            <li>2 chicken thighs, curry, chopped</li>
            <li>¾ cup sauce from chicken curry</li>    
        </ul>
    <h2>Preperation Steps</h2>
    
    <h4>For the Pizza</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat a large, well-seasoned cast-iron pan or wok over high heat with 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil just starts to smoke, add the eggs, and scramble them until cooked dry. Transfer to a bowl, and wipe the pan clean. (Alternatively, you can scramble them in a nonstick pan.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Return the pan to medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of oil and ginger. When it is aromatic, add pandan and curry leaves, and cook, stirring, until the ginger is light golden, 20 seconds. Add scallions and carrots. Stir for 1 minute, then add onion. Cook, stirring, until onion has only a little snap, about 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce and salt to taste, and remove to a bowl. Wipe the pan out.</p></li>
            <li><p>Return pan to medium heat, and add the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil. (If the flatbread you are using is very oily, use less oil in the pan.) When it’s shimmering hot, add roti, and stir until it feels dry and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, cooked vegetables and eggs. Add the curry sauce, and continue to stir until hot all the way through. Taste, add more salt or soy sauce if necessary and serve.</p></li>
        </ol>
